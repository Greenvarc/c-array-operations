### code organization and how to run

To vavoid a very long main file I rearange my code by making a module (actions.h)  
the main.c file contain all main functionality(actions) of the apps  
the actions.c file contain all actions that are peformed on the array and  
the action.c contain functions header , to make them usable in the main function and other files  
to use those functions i imported them using `#include "action.h`

to compile the code run `gcc -g *.c -o ./bin/main` ; the binary file will be stored in the bin  
 folder and named `main.exe` if using windows as specified in the code `gcc -g *c -o filename|path+filename`
